# Project Description

* For this second project, your task will be to tell a story through visualizations.

* Unlike the first project, where you focused on using the analytics paradigm to explore relationships in report form, this project should be more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.

* Just as with the first project, you will lead a 10-minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization. Try not to spend too much time on any one area -- you want to address them in the presentation as is relevant.

* You may choose any theme for your project, but you're encouraged to think broadly. Don't limit yourself to what you already know.

* You may, and are encouraged, to work in self-selected groups of 3-4. You may work alone, but recognize that you will be responsible for _all_ of the work.

* You will have two weeks to complete this project, beginning on Saturday, April 6th, and presenting your completed project on Saturday, April 20th.


# Specific Requirements

1. Your visualization must use a Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite).

2. Your project should fall into one of the below **four tracks**:

  - A custom "creative" D3 project (i.e., non-standard graph or chart). You can look to [Visual Cinnamon](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/) for inspiration, but you are not expected to create something that ornate.

  - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly.

  - A dashboard page with multiple charts updating from the same data, or subsets of the same data.

  - A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization. Ask about this if interested -- it's challenging but doable.

3. Your project can include JS libraries that we did not cover. You are encouraged to branch out here.

4. Your project must rely on a dataset with **at least 100 records**. Try to go for more, but a dataset of a million records might become unwieldy for the scope of this project.

5. Your project must include some level of **user-driven interaction**, e.g., menus, dropdowns, text boxes, inputs, etc.

6. Your final visualization should include **at least three charts**, whether displayed simultaneously or one at a time.

7. Remember that all your code must be made available in a GitHub repo. It is up to you how you decide to present your project -- you can use any combination of Jupyter notebooks, Powerpoints, etc., but you must also demonstrate the use of your visualizations live in class. Keep in mind that you're telling a story with data.
